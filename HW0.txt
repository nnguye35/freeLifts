  We are looking to create a web application that allows the user to create their own workout programs. We intend to set up a baseline of
default workouts but also give the chance for the user to input or search for their own workouts. The application will utilize certain API's
to provide information such as form and suggest rep ranges, such as tutorials to do the certain workout. Using D3.js we can implement a progression table,
everytime the user has clear the set ranges for their workout, this should allow the user to see their progress over a certain amount of time.
The application will in the end supply a user interface to implement their own personalized workout program, track how many sets and rep they complete,
as well as check off whether they completed the sets, and then shows the progression of the user to see how much weight had been accomplished.
